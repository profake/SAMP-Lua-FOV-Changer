# SAMP-Lua-FOV-Changer  
LUA SAMP FOV Changer.  
This is not my script. I was asked to add the ability to adjust the FOV on this mod, and I added just that.  
Original script is by Receiver, credits are in the LUA.  

### [Pre-requisites]
1. ASI Loader
2. Moonloader
3. SAMPFuncs
4. mimgui for Moonloader

### [Installation]
Put the __FishEyeEffect.lua__ file from this repository to your Moonloader folder.  
  
### [Usage]
Type __/camm__ to enable the mod, and __/fov__ to show the slider which allows you to change it.  

### [Known issues]
1. There's an odd camera shake at FOVs below 150.

### [Credits]
FYP for Moonloader, SAMP addon and ImGui port for Moonloader.  
Receiver for the original script.
